Health Monitoring Dashboard
This project is a Streamlit-based health monitoring dashboard that allows users to input their health data, receive warnings for abnormal values, and visualize historical trends for key metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2, and temperature.

Features
Real-time Input & Feedback:
Users can input health metrics (heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2, and temperature) using sliders.
Instant feedback is provided with warnings for abnormal values.
Interactive Graphs:
Visualizes historical trends for each health metric.
Simulated Data:
Generates simulated time-series data to demonstrate functionality.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Streamlit: Framework for creating the interactive web dashboard.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
NumPy: For generating random data.
Matplotlib: Integrated for graphing (if needed).
